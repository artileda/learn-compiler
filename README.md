# Learn making compiler

Hello there, this ma private experiment creating compiler this maybe one of my year resolution after stagnan in limbo of uncertain mentall condition, I affirm my self to learn fundamental by code and theorem then this repo is shape of those will. This part will separated in different folder and had own README for its details.

If you wanna follow this lead, make sure you had OCaml installed (If lazy i'll provide docker image for ya).

### Writting convention

Sorry if my english bad and kind look people drunk who write a letter, and if i looks stop writting maybe i am got stuck, lazy , overwhelmed ,depressed and *you name it* (i hope not dead yet). But that fine, happy reading and fun.

In future, i planned to make indonesian translation but i am lazy, may this august.

- [Borreti, good to start code with Menhir](https://borretti.me/article/parsing-menhir-forth)
- [Parsing: The Solved Problem That Isn't, first to good read for who didn't get what compiler do](https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/entries/parsing_the_solved_problem_that_isnt.html)
- [Engineering a Compiler, this book is so thicc good for make you sleep and dream bout compiler](https://github.com/germanoa/compiladores/blob/master/doc/ebook/Engineering%20a%20Compiler%20-%202nd%20Edition%20-%20K.%20Cooper%2C%20L.%20Torczon%20(Morgan%20Kaufman%2C%202012).pdf)
  
That is i think, fun fact OCaml had stream data type but i had no idea how to use it maybe good for you to write parser from scratch.
